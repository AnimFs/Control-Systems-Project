## Self-Balancing Monopod: A Reaction Wheel Inverted Pendulum
The basic goal of this project is to build such a user-friendly and most importantly cost-effective self-balancing monopod which works on the basis of a reaction wheel inverted pendulum. Basically, the motor at the top of the monopod spin-up and spin-down, creating a torque on the monopod. That torque is used to bring the monopod back to its most stable position,
thereby preventing it from falling. The monopod is also designed in such a way that it can handle slight disturbances (for example: wind). The IMU combining the gyro and accelerometer, uses the current angle and change in angle with respect to time (angular speed) to create torque to the motor using a PID control algorithm. <br>
